# Smart Medical Bot (Demo Project)

This is a small experimental project created mainly to **try out a few Python libraries**.

The goal of the project is to:
- Parse user-written symptoms (free text)
- Match them against a small symptom database
- Suggest possible diseases using **TF-IDF** and **cosine similarity**
- Act as a simple command-line medical bot

This project is **not medically accurate** and is only for learning and experimentation.

## Libraries Tested
- scikit-learn
- basic NLP techniques (TF-IDF)
- text normalization and similarity matching

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

You enter symptoms in plain text, and the program suggests possible conditions.
