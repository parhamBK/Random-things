# Quiz Score Normalization

During a day of running quizzes at the university, I noticed that one group received a much easier quiz than another.
This caused a large and unfair difference in scores.

To solve this, I wrote a simple Python program that:

- Normalizes quiz scores using a normal distribution
- Adjusts the easier quiz to match the harder one
- Generates a final PDF report with statistics and plots

The goal is to make quiz results fair and comparable across different groups.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

The program generates a PDF report with the adjusted results.
